PyChord
=======
Chord sheet parser, written in Python 3.x

[Project on Github](https://github.com/jm-welch/PyChord)

Description
-----------

This is designed to - eventually - replicate the Chordii parsing language, using Python as the backend.

I'm doing this as a way to learn more about Python outside of work, so some things may not wind up being possible, but I have high hopes.
